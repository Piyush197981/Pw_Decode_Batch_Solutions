#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

double getAverage(int arr[], int size);

int main(){

    int balance[5] = {1000, 2, 3, 17, 50};
    double avg;
    avg = getAverage(balance[0], 5 ) ;
    cout << "Average value is: " << avg << endl;

return 0;
}


error :-
the error is while calling the function we are passing an array there so will pass like balance not balance[0]. balance[0] means we are passing the first element but we need to pass the array not the first element if we use balance or &balance[0] then it is correct
